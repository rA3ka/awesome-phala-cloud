# EVM MCP

A Model Context Protocol server for interacting with the EVM blockchain, powered by the [EVM AI Kit](https://github.com/mcp-dao/evm-agent-kit).

## Overview

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI models to interact with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) blockchain. It leverages the EVM AI Kit to provide a robust interface for blockchain interactions.

## Features

- EVM blockchain interaction through MCP
- TypeScript implementation
- Express.js server
- Environment-based configuration

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (Latest LTS version recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Access to an EVM-compatible blockchain node
